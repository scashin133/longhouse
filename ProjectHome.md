## Introduction to Longhouse ##

This project page represents the Longhouse project, begun by [Informatics](http://www.ics.uci.edu/informatics/) students at the University of California, Irvine, in conjunction with representatives of [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p).

Longhouse is an open-source collaborative development environment (CDE) based on Google Code. Longhouse provides software project hosting, issue tracking, and a space for collaborative work on software projects. Unlike Google Code, Longhouse is intended for small- to medium-sized organizations or communities that wish to host their own software projects. Thus, Longhouse may be installed on a modern personal computer or small- to medium-sized server to serve your organization's project hosting and management needs.

Longhouse employs a unique means of storing project data and making data accessible, storing information in XML format on your organization's Subversion repository. This means that you can edit any project artifacts outside the Longhouse Web UI, commit the modified XML files to your Subversion repository, and have Longhouse automatically take into account your changes.

Longhouse aims to preserve the usability paradigms of Google applications while adding additional usability optimizations designed to maximize understandability, new-user-friendliness and productivity.

We invite you to [learn more](LearnMore.md) about Longhouse, and to [get Longhouse](http://code.google.com/p/longhouse/downloads/list).
