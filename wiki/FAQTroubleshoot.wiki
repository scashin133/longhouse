== Installing Longhouse ==

*Q:* I can't run `yaml_to_bo.py`! I get an `ImportError: No module named yaml`.

*A:* Add these lines to the top of `yaml_to_bo.py`:

`import sys`

`sys.path.append("path")`

Where `path` is the `working_dir:` value you specified in `config.yml`.

== Running and Shutting Down Longhouse ==

*Q:* I specified `daemonized: true`, and now I can't shut down Longhouse. How do I stop it?

*A:* Run the file `shutdown.py` in the `/src` folder.

== Using Longhouse ==

*Q:* Longhouse keeps giving me messages indicating that a feature isn't implemented yet. What's up with that?

*A:* Depending on your version of Longhouse, the development team might not be done porting features that exist in Google Code. First, make sure you're up-to-date on the latest version of Longhouse. If you are, check the Longhouse issue tracker to see if work is scheduled to be started or completed soon on the feature that you want to use.
