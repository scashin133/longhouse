= How to Install and Run Longhouse =

== Part 1: Pre-requisites ==

Longhouse requires:
  * Python 2.5.2 - http://www.python.org/
  * Subversion - http://subversion.tigris.org/

If you don't have one or either of these, make sure to install them before attempting to perform the rest of this guide.

== Part 2: Installation ==

Download the latest Longhouse install from Longhouse's Google Code site, at http://code.google.com/p/longhouse/. Decompress the archive and place the source files where you'd like them to reside - the specific location doesn't matter for the purposes of running the software. You should see a `/src` folder inside the folder created when you decompressed the Longhouse archive, and inside the `/src` folder should be all of the Longhouse source files.

== Part 3: Configuration ==

Longhouse requires a configuration file in order to run properly. Navigate to the directory that you copied the Longhouse source files to. Inside the `/src` directory, you should see several files, including:
  * `COPYING`
  * `example_config.yml`
  * `run.py`
  * `shutdown.py`

You're going to need to create a config file in order to ensure that Longhouse runs properly. If a file called `config.yml` or `config.yaml` doesn't exist, go ahead and create it as a plain text file inside the `/src` directory.

The Longhouse config file has five values that need to be present in order for Longhouse to run. You can see these values in the `example_config.yml` file, but we'll go over them again here.

The first value is the `working_dir` variable. This variable describes where the Longhouse source files are located on your system. For example, if the directory that I moved my Longhouse files to was `/Users/exampleuser/Longhouse`, I'd write, as the first line of the `config.yml` file:

`working_dir: /Users/exampleuser/Longhouse/src`

Make sure to include the `/src` at the end of your `working_dir`! It's very important that this path point directly to where your `config.yml` file is located.

The next value to specify is the port you want the Longhouse server to run on. Choose whatever value you want that won't contradict any other services running on your machine. One common port to use is port `8080`. We recommend simply using `8080` unless there is another program using it, or another reason to not use it. The line describing the port looks like:

`port: 8080`

The third value you're going to define is whether you want the process to be daemonized or not. If you use the value `true`, when you run Longhouse, it will spawn a separate process, so you'll be free to close your Python environment or command-line invocation. If you use `false`, it behaves like a regular Python application, running while your invocation of the Python runtime environment is active. So, this line looks like the following:

`daemonized: true`
or
`daemonized: false`

Next, specify whether you want Longhouse to log itself to a log file or not.

`logging: true`
or
`logging: false`

Finally, specify the location of your subversion process. For example, mine is located at `/usr/local/bin/svn`, so I'd write:

`svn: /usr/local/bin/svn`

My entire config file is as follows:

`working_dir: /Users/exampleuser/Longhouse/src`

`port: 8080`

`daemonized: false`

`logging: true`

`svn: /usr/local/bin/svn`

== Part 4: Setup ==

Longhouse's setup is easy once you've made the config file properly. in the `/src/scripts` directory, run the Python file `yaml_to_bo.py`. This script generates the Python files describing the data types that will be used in Longhouse by examining the Yaml files describing the fields of the data types. If you don't run this script, you won't be able to run Longhouse.

== Part 5: Run ==

Run the file `run.py` in the `/src` directory. If all goes well, Longhouse should be running properly. If you encounter any errors, check our [FAQTroubleshoot FAQ/Troubleshooting page].

== Part 6: Use Longhouse ==

Visit `http://localhost:portnumber/` to test whether Longhouse is running, where `portnumber` is the value you specified for `port` in the `config.yml` file. If you encounter an 'Unable to connect' or similar error, it means Longhouse isn't running on that port for one reason or another. Check our [FAQTroubleshoot FAQ/Troubleshooting page] to find out why.

== Part 7: Shut Down ==

If you specified `daemonized: true` in the `config.yml` file, you need to run `shutdown.py` to shut Longhouse down. If not, simply exit the program in which you invoked `run.py`.
