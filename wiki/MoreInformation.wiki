== Persistence Layer ==

Longhouse stores the data related to your projects in XML files. Optionally, you can have these XML files committed to a remote Subversion repository of your choosing. In the future,
you'll be able to install a commit hook onto a repository, which will allow you to update these XML files from your Subversion server and have
Longhouse automatically take your updates into account.

If you want to have your XML files stored to your Subversion repository, use the Persistence tool in the Administer tab in a project you own.  They'll get committed to the repository you specify there when they're changed via the Web UI.

If you don't want this functionality, just leave the field in the Persistence tool blank.

== What Features Aren't Implemented Yet? ==

Depending on the version of Longhouse you're running, some things might not be implemented yet.
 Odds are that we already know about what's missing and we'll be working on it soon.

See the [WhatGoingOn what's going on?] page for an up-to-date list of what will be worked on in the future.

In addition, check the issue list to see what tasks we've planned out in the near future.
