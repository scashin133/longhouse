 <h3>Introduction</h3>

 <p>
 	This is the senior design project for the Informatics program at UCI. 
 	Our goal is to make an open source project hosting solution based off the 
 	Google Code Collaborative Development Environment (CDE). This system will 
 	be installed on a project's own servers instead of running on Google's servers. 
 	In the short term we will be porting the system from Google proprietary 
 	technologies to open source solutions. In the future we will introduce some 
 	new ideas based off feedback and observations from the open source community.
 </p>

 <p>
 	We hope that this project is not only a single successful open source project, 
 	but also produces a system that benefits the open source community as a whole. 
 	After June 2008 we will continue this project and promote it as a fully-fledged 
 	open source project by getting the word out and allowing other people to 
 	contribute their own design, coding, and testing skills.

 <h3>Design Guidelines and Environmental Constraints</h3>

 <p><b>Project development constraints</b></p>
 <ul>
  <li>This project with its associated documents and code will be hosted as a 
      project on code.google.com.</li>
  <li>The entirety of the code for this project will be open source under the 
      Apache 2.0 license.</li>
  <li>The project is based on the existing 
  	<a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code</a> project. 
  	See the <a href="design.html">design document</a>
	for information about how this influences the design.
	</li>
 </ul>
 
 <p><b>Environment</b></p>
 <ul>
  <li>This system will run on a mid-level server running a Unix environment.</li>
  <li>Subversion is assumed to have already been installed on this server, 
      but we make no further assumptions about the nature of the subversion 
      installation or configuration.</li>
 </ul> 
 
 <p><b>Language</b></p>
 <ul>
  <li>The system will be written in Python 2.5.1</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Non-Functional Requirements</h3>

 <p><b>Reliability</b></p>
 <ul><li>
   The system shall be reliable. System downtime could have a very detrimental 
   effect on the projects hosted using this system and should be minimized. 
   Under no circumstances will accidental data malformation or loss caused by 
   the system be acceptable. However, data malformation or loss could still 
   happen if the system's interface is bypassed, an issue brought up in the 
   "robustness" requirement below. 
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><b>Compatibility</b></p>
  <ul><li>
   All rendered pages shall render <i>acceptably well</i> on the major browsers 
   being used on the Internet. This includes Firefox, Safari, Opera, Netscape, 
   and Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and 7. By <i>acceptably well</i> we acknowledge 
   that pages will not render identically across all browsers, but what is 
   rendered shall still be usable.
  </li></ul>
  
  <p><b>Robustness</b></p>
  <ul><li>
   The system shall be robust. Since users will be allowed to make changes 
   to their project(s) by bypassing the web interface (such as by using a third 
   party subversion client) there is the potential for the project to contain 
   malformed or missing data. The system will gracefully handle data integrity 
   issues.
  </li></ul>
  
  <p><b>Open Source</b></p>
  <ul><li>
   This project will act as a good example of open source methodologies and practices, 
   as laid out in [1] and [2].
  </li>
  
  <li>
   After completion of the Informatics 191 course in June 2008, development of the 
   system will continue indefinitely as a fully fledged open source project (still 
   under the Apache 2.0 license). Contributers other than the four individuals 
   taking the course will be welcome and encouraged to make contributions to the 
   project. 
  </li></ul>
