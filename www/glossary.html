 <h3>Project-specific Terms</h3>
<!--
 <div class="tip">
  TIPs: 
  <ul>
   <li>Define HTML anchors on your terms with id="TERMNAME" so that
   other documents can link to the definition of specific terms.</li>

   <li>If there is any question about the meaning of a term, note it
   here.  If someone (e.g., the customer) gave you a definition to
   use, note that here too.  If something is best defined by using a
   hyperlink to another document or website, include a hyperlink in
   the definition.</li>

   <li>If a term was used in the past, but is no longer going to be
   used, you should keep it in the list, mark it as "deprecated", and
   link to the term or terms that replace it.  E.g., deprecated
   standard term <a href="glossary-std.html#bug">bug</a>.</li>

   <li>Define only project-specific terms, or ones that a new team
   member would not know.  Don't define standard textbook terms that
   can be easily found elsewhere.</li>

   <li>This glossary can serve as simple domain model or data
   dictionary.  You can define important data objects by describing
   their meaning and key attributes. For example, see <a
   href="#student">student</a> and <a href="#gpa">GPA</a>.</li>

 <div id="anonymous-visitor"><dt>Anonymous Visitor</dt>
 <dd>Anonymous visitors are visitors who do not have an account with
 Google, or are not logged into their account. Anonymous visitors can
 access the project home page, and existing content in the downloads,
 wiki and issues sections of the project page. Anonymous visitors can 
 access the project's resources via subversion, logging in anonymously
 to check out the most recent version of each project resource.</dd></div>

 <div id="identified-visitor"><dt>Identified Visitor</dt>
  <dd>An identified visitor is a user that is visiting a project's page
  without being a member of that project. Identified visitors can do
  everything that anonymous visitors can, and also add comments to
  specific wiki pages and issue entries.</dd></div>

 <div id="project-member"><dt>Project Member</dt>
 <dd>Project members are the users who have elected to join a project, or
 who have been added to the ranks of a project by a project owner. Project members
 have all the privileges of identified visitors, as well as being able to add
 new issues, new downloads and new wiki pages, as well as changing the information
 related to issues and downloads, and editing wiki pages. When accessing a project 
 via subversion, a project member may log in using his or her username and 
 password to allow committing changes.</dd></div>

 <div  id="project-owner"><dt>Project Owner</dt>
 <dd>Project owners are the users who have created a project, and the project
 contributors whom the original owner has appointed as owners. Project owners
 may perform the same actions as project members, and may also change the 
 settings related to the different sections of the project home page, as well
 as controlling who is promoted to project contributor and project owner status.</dd></div>

 <div id="system-administrator"><dt>System Administrator</dt>
 <dd>The system administrator is typically the person who owns and controls the 
 server that the system is running on, and users that he or she has appointed to
 the role. System administrators have the privileges that a project owner has
 in all projects, and can also increase the amount of disk space allotted to
 the project, hide projects from being visible to non-members, ban users from the system,
 and change miscellaneous settings in the system.</dd></div>

<div id="T"></div> <!-- /T -->

<div id="U">
 <div id="user"><dt>User</dt>
 <dd>A User is a person using the system in any role. User roles are hierarchical; 
 any given role had its unique permissions in addition to any permissions for roles 
 beneath it. The following is a list of user roles in order of least permissions to most:<br> 
 <a href="#anonymous-visitor">Anonymous Visitor</a> &lt;
 <a href="#identified-visitor">Identified Visitor</a> &lt; 
 <a href="#project-member">Project Member</a> &lt;
