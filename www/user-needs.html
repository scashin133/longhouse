 <h3>Agreed Goals</h3>

  TODO: Has there been a clear statement of the overall goal of this
  project that the stakeholders agree to?  If so, paste it here or add
  a hyperlink.  If not, you should summarize your understanding of the
  project goals into a brief statement and try to get the stakeholders
  to agree to it.  The text below gives three alternative examples,
  select one, or write your own.
 </div> -->

 <p class="sample2">After several communications with stakeholders the following is the agreed upon project goal:</p>
 <blockquote>Our goal is to make an open source project hosting solution based off the Google Code Collaborative Development Environment (CDE).</blockquote>

 <h3>Environment</h3>

 <!-- <div class="todo">
  TODO: Briefly describe various aspects of the environment where the
  software will be used.  Describe the environment as it <i>is</i> or
  <i>will be</i>, not what you would wish it to become.  The text
  below gives a few examples.
 </div> -->

 <dl>
<!--
  <dt>What is the system's business environment?</dt>

   <dd class="sample1">Each real estate agent works with a set of
  potential buyers and sellers.  Real estate agents do not share
  customer data with other agents, because they do not want to share
  commissions.  Information on specific available homes changes daily,
  and this tool must help them keep up.</dd>

  <dd class="sample2">Game players may visit several free web sites to
  find information about teams or "clans".  There is usually more
  information available than they would choose to read, the challenge
  is in having the most fun with the least effort.  This website must
  be familiar to players who have used other sites, but it must also
  be better.</dd> -->


  <dt>What is the system's physical environment?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">This system makes no assumptions about the type of web server that it is being hosted on.  The
	physical environment should be accommodated no matter what situation.</dd>
	
  <dt>What is the system's technology environment (hardware and software)?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">The hardware should be a mid-level server.</dd>

  <dd class="sample2">The system will be a unix operating system.  The system will be running Python and will require a subversion repository.</dd>

 <h3>Stakeholders / Actors</h3>

 <!-- <div class="todo">
  TODO: List and describe the stakeholders for this product.  These
  can be named individuals or roles that people play.  For each
  stakeholder, list/rank their key needs.  Consider the expected
  technical expertise of the stakeholders and how often they are
  likely to use the system, as well as key strengths, weaknesses,
  preferences, or other characteristics.  Use a greater-than sign to
  indicate inheritance among types of actors.
 </div>

 <div class="tip">
  TIP: To get information on types of users, you can talk to actual
  users.  You may also want to talk to user surrogates (people who
  work with users), such as domain experts, technical trainers,
  technical support staff, technical writers, supervisors of users,
  and your own sales and marketing department.  You can find clues in
  manuals and marketing materials for competing products.

  <dd>A user of open source is going to want to know details about a open source project quickly and with minimal effort.
	Things like how active the project is, the purpose of the project, what stage of development it is in.  They also will want
	to report about what is wrong with the software and be able to receive updates.

   <p>Key needs:</p>

	from a beginner in open source development to more advanced.   
	

   <p>Key needs:</p>
   <ol>
		<li>Contribute code and documents</li>
		<li>Updates about current development</li>

   </ol>
  </dd>

  <dt id="zivandsameer">Professor Ziv and Sameer</dt>

  <dd>Although they may never actually use the product it is still very important to them that the project succeed.  They
	are the people who coordinated our project and talked to Google about starting up a project.  They will help coach us into
	making better documents and help to keep up on track.  

   <p>Key needs:</p>
   <ol>
		<li>Customer stays happy</li>
		<li>Have a working displayable result by the end of each quarter and a working product by the end of the year</li>
   </ol>
  </dd>

  <dt id="jason">Jason (Customer)</dt>

  <dd> Works for Google and is helping us to make sure that the project stays on course and within vision.  He has a great amount
	of domain knowledge when it comes to open source and will be sharing it with us to help keep the project moving forward.

   <p>Key needs:</p>
   <ol>
		<li>Turn into thriving open source project</li>
